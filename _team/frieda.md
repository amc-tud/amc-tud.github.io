**Research Interests:** 

* Neural signatures underlying the information transfer between working memory (WM) and long-term memory (LTM), examined through fMRI and behavioral experiments
* Subsequent memory effects and representational dynamics of WM–LTM interaction, investigated using univariate and multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA)
* Human–machine alignment in visual representations, explored through computational modeling and machine learning–based representational analysis

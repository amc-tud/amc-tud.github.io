**Research Interests:**  
My research focuses on mechanisms and modulators of goal-directed behavior.
- I am particularly interested in prospective remembering, intention deactivation, shielding and shifting of intentions, and effects of acute and chronic stress on cognitive functions.
- Currently, I investigate whether we can manipulate the balance between stable shielding of task goals and flexible switching between them.
- I aim to specify the micro-structure and sub-processes of intention retrieval in prospective memory, as well as PM deficits in (sub)clinical mental health concerns.
